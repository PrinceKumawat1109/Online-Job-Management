Project Title*: Online Job Management System


Problem Statement/Opportunity*: The present system requires applicants to search through print and visual media for job opportunities. 
                                Applicants need to apply for jobs using conventional methods and appear for interview on a specified date at a specified location. 
                                Employers need to advertise the vacancies and sort all applicant details, conduct selection procedures and complete the formalities. 
                                This approach is tedious and requires much effort and resources. There is need of an online job portal where applicants easily find 
                                the jobs and employer can find suitable candidates for the job .


Project Description*: The project objective is to find jobs online. The Job Management System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the 
                      Net and can be accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application will reserve the jobs. This online job management system provides a website for a 
                      company where any user of internet can access it. User is required to login to the system. Finding jobs can really be difficult. The website provides complete 
                      information regarding currently applicable jobs on all the screens with all the details needed. Our online job management system is one of the best opportunities 
                      for those who cannot afford enough time to find jobs easily.
                      People can apply for jobs online at any time of day or night. Our management system also provides option to cancel for the jobs which were applied previously.


Primary Azure Technology*: Web Apps, API Apps, Visual Studio Code.


Other Azure Technologies: Choose the operating system and development tools you need to run your large-scale jobs on Batch. Batch gives you a consistent management 
                          experience and job scheduling, whether you select Windows Server or Linux compute nodes, but it lets you take advantage of the unique features of each environment. 
                          With Windows, use your existing Windows code, including Microsoft .NET, to run large-scale compute jobs in Azure. With Linux, choose from popular distributions including 
                          CentOS, Ubuntu, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to run your compute jobs, or use Docker containers to lift and shift your applications. Batch gives you SDKs and 
                          supports a range of development tools including Python and Java Batch runs the applications that you use on workstations and clusters. It is easy to cloud-enable 
                          your executable files and scripts to scale out. Batch provides a queue to receive the work that you want to run and executes your applications. Describe the data 
                          that need to be moved to the cloud for processing, how the data should be distributed, what parameters to use for each task and the command to start the process. 
                          Think about it like an assembly line with multiple applications. With Batch, you can share data between steps and manage the execution as a whole.
